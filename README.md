# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

In order to be prepared for the fast paced and incentive bootcamp, I built a webpage from scratch by following a detailed and extensive guide. It allowed me to become familiar with all sorts of code language and the use of css, java and html. I was exposed to many different elements and inputs, as well as became accustomed the the command prompt, or gitbash, as well as github.
